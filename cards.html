        <p><strong>Problem</strong> with "simplest cards"  . . . they look not so great if the cards have content in them that isn't equal in size.  Of course, most ppl's cards do so . . .?</p>

			<p><small>Rant:  Why did they name an aside and aside without making it default positioned off to the the side and why isn't there another "semantic" html tag called <span class="codey">sidebar</span>, like there is for <span class="codey">footer</span> and <span class="codey">header</span>.  while we're at it, why not <span class="codey">mainContent</span> or even just <span class="codey">main</span> as well?  Thanks for listening.</small></p>
