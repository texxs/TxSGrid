# TxSGrid

### Overview
The goal is an easy to learn and use CSS Grid framework for most situations.  Maybe not even a framework but more like a HTML boilerplate.  Even better said,  a small collection of HTML boilerplate files all using the same styles of HTML, CSS and JS technology.  Some of the same  supporting CSS files could be used for the different.  Personally I would to use as little JS as possible.

####  ToDo
This isn't the appropriate place for a to do list now is it?  Well, some say "Sure, If you don't have anything else to put there yet, like installation instructions, etc, then why the F not?"
