# TxSGrid

### Overview
The goal is an easy to learn and use CSS Grid framework for most situations.  Maybe not even a framework but more like a HTML boilerplate.  Even better said,  a small collection of HTML boilerplate files all using the same styles of HTML, CSS and JS technology.  Some of the same  supporting CSS files could be used for the different.  Personally I would to use as little JS as possible.
