			<p>When matching oneself with teams that need a team player with my skills and talents, one of the biggest obstacles are the labels that both parties use before they meet each other. Specificlly, the many different names one could resonablly use to describe just about every skill.  For example, "Web Design" is referred to as the core technologies involved like "HMTL, CSS and JavaScript" sometimes it's called "Web Development" etc. in the first example, each of those thre specific skills sometimes have version numbers added on. The same skill, "Web Design" could be "HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery".</p> 
			<p>And then there are specialties within each skill, like "reponsive Design", "Css Grid" or "CSS Flexbox" and more.  These each have their own variant labels like "Adaptive Design" for "Responsive Design" and all of these specific examples not only be applied to "Web Design" but also HTML or CSS.</p>
			<p>When you add an APS (Applicant Tracking System) or other automated processes that screen resumes and cover letters and/or HR staff that are great at what they do but know little to nothing about Web Development and an individual with a long list skills. Many people get disqualified and/or overlooked because these applications are only searching for one or two variant labels of each skill and thus not finding them on some resumes for people that are listing these skills.</p>
			<p>This list is a way to overcome this.</p>
