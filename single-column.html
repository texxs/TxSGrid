        <h2>Objectives</h2>
    	<p>So far I have a simple 2 column, 3 row grid.  I'd like to use it as a boilerplate for starting any 3 row, 2 column page I'd like to build in this "website".  I know the design is real sparse here and that's important because this website is really just about figuring some things out once and for all, and even getting more and more complicated as  I go. When I've master this, I'll start adding different layouts, more complicated components, like columns (in the footer perhaps?), cards, modals and navbars etc.  Then I'll perhaps go even further and add some different page types like image gallery pages, hero pages, etc.</p>
    <p>I know this is repeated in the sidebar but on other pages, that text may not be there r this text may not be here.  Plus this is a chance for  me to tell you about the <em>"secret"</em> objective.  If everything goes well and I have time, I'd like to release an open source boot strap killer CSS Grid Framework.  I'll be rich and famous!  Okay maybe not, bit if I could help drive the nail in Bootstrap and to a lesser extent Foundation, Materialize, and all lesser known traditional monster CSS Boilerplate type frameworks, I'd be very happy.  That okay with you?</p>

      For some reason the font on my ghost buttons, example below, looks like a different size than usual?  Maybe I've changed it somewhere
    </p>
		<p class="centered-text"><a href="index.html"><button class="dark-ghost-button">Home Page</button></a></p>
    <p>Calling it (the ghost buttons font size) fixed?</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>WishList / Future List</h3>
    <p>Okay I've fixed enough small crap to move on to adding new things.  But where to start?  How do I remember what I want to do next when I resume work on this the next day?  A list of stuff here can't hurt.  Maybe later I'll move it to a new page.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Other Templates
        <ul>
          <li>Let's start with a single column layout and then a left column side bar layout, etc. I guess each layout will get it's own stylesheet that contains the grid for that layout and <span class="codey">styles.css</span> will just have common things like the headings and buttons etc.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Add Navigation!</strong> . . . duh</li>
      <li>Photo Gallery</li>
      <li>Cards</li>
      <li>Forms</li>
      <li>Add the random photo script to the sidebar?
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/php/randomize-background-image/" target="_blan k">Here's</a>  how you would do it in PHP, red down in the comments and you'll see how to do it without even building an array like you would have to with JavaScript. But then I'd have to make all these pages PHP pages . . .</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Add something to the footer? (like random text? and/or columns?)</li>
    </ul>

			<p><small>Rant:  Why did they name an aside and aside without making it default positioned off to the the side and why isn't there another "semantic" html tag called <span class="codey">sidebar</span>, like there is for <span class="codey">footer</span> and <span class="codey">header</span>.  while we're at it, why not <span class="codey">mainContent</span> or even just <span class="codey">main</span> as well?  Thanks for listening.</small></p>
